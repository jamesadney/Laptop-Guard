- The username and password refer to those of your outgoing mail account (for 
sending text message alert)

- ONLY GMAIL is supported right now because this is what I have and I wrote the
program just for myself at first. This will be more generic in the future.
This is not securely stored (simply encoded using base64).  Soon this will be
saved in the gnome-keyring.

- It is important to remember the "Lock Screen Password"!! The default is 
"password"
