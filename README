laptop-alarm locks your screen and then waits to be triggered.

The alarm can be triggered by:
(1) Unplugging the computer from ac power
(2) Pressing the power button (at least on my computer)
(3) Pressing ctrl + alt keys at the same time
(4) Shutting the lid of the computer

When triggered, laptop alarm:
(1) Plays an alarm sound while it
    (a) Takes a picture with a webcam
    (b) Sends a picture message to a phone number of your choosing
